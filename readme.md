WITH customer_rfm AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), MAX(transaction_date)) as recency,
    COUNT(transaction_id) as frequency,
    SUM(transaction_amount) as monetary
  FROM transactions
  WHERE transaction_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 2 YEAR)
  GROUP BY customer_id
),
rfm_scores AS (
  SELECT *,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY recency DESC) as r_score,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY frequency) as f_score,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY monetary) as m_score
  FROM customer_rfm
)
SELECT *,
  CONCAT(r_score, f_score, m_score) as rfm_segment
FROM rfm_scores;
